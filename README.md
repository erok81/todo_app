# Desktop to do list using PySimpleGUI

I needed a simple todo application for work to cut down on Post It notes.

It can add, remove and edit items. To do list is saved locally so it will always
be updated if program unexpectedly closes.

Two files included; a .py and a .pyw. The .pyw can be run without tying up the terminal

Current issues:
o Crashes if all items are removed and remove button is clicked again
